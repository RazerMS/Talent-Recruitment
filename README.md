## Views From Our Insiders
- Peer to peer learning and casual discussions are commonly seen in every corner in our office, even in the pantry!  
- Regardless of the person's personal position or ranking, we encourage a flat hierarchical structure, instead of the traditional software development methodology which has sequential structure and strict hierarchical order in its teams.  
- We do not throw a big project and expect an intern to complete all features by him/herself, we would say our environment is closer to adopting Agile and Lean methodology (as opposed to Waterfall), where we would split all the features of a big project into smaller chunks.  
- Lean thinking, teams increase speed by managing flow (usually by limiting work-in-process), whereas in Agile, teams emphasize small batch sizes to deliver quickly (often in sprints).  
- All in all, you can expect we play like an eSports team, as aligned with our parent company Razer Inc's branding, where each player has his/her own role, not everyone has to be a Carry (Tanker or Fighter or Initiator), we would appreciate a good Support role (Healer) also, or even a Silent/Stealth Assassin who complete missions in the dark with low profile.
